# Commonwealth Bank Data Science Virtual Simulation

This repository showcases my work for the **Commonwealth Bank Data Science Virtual Simulation** on Forage. The simulation involved four tasks focused on data aggregation, anonymization, analysis, and database design.

## Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Data Aggregation and Analysis**
- Collected and aggregated data from multiple sources.
- Cleaned and preprocessed datasets for analysis.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.

### **Task 2: Data Anonymisation**
- Implemented data anonymization techniques to protect sensitive information.
- Ensured compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Documented the anonymization process for transparency and reproducibility.

### **Task 3: Propose Data Analysis Approaches**
- Proposed data analysis strategies to address specific business questions.
- Outlined methodologies for extracting actionable insights from datasets.
- Recommended tools and techniques for effective data analysis.

### **Task 4: Designing a Database**
- Designed a normalized database schema for efficient data storage.
- Created tables and defined relationships using primary and foreign keys.
- Optimized the database for scalability and performance.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Aggregation**: Collecting and preprocessing data from diverse sources.
- **Data Privacy**: Anonymizing sensitive data while maintaining usability.
- **Data Analysis**: Proposing and implementing analysis strategies.
- **Database Design**: Creating structured and scalable databases.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (Database Design)
